Will need Goggle cloud keys from DialogFlow in `credentials.json` at the root of this project

To build, run `./gradlew build` - this will run HelloControllerIT.java, and if that test succeeds, will create a jar in `build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar
`
Run the jar using `java -jar build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar`
